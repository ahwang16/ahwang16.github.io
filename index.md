<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; flex-direction: column;">
    <p>I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I work with Professors <a href="https://www.andrewhead.info">Andrew Head</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/">Chris Callison-Burch</a> on Human-AI Interaction. <b>I work on supporting fluid and informative conversations with large language models. I am particularly interested in helping users manage many details at once through voice, text, or AR/VR assistants.</b></p>

    <p>Beyond research, I am a chair of the <a href="https://penn-cisda.github.io">CIS Doctoral Association</a> and the founder of our department's Mentorship Program. I also care a lot about outreach programs, like the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dive/">Diversity and Equity Initiative in the Mind Sciences</a> (DivE In Weekend). I have interned at Google and AWS, and my work has been featured by Tech Crunch, the Associated Press, and over 100 other US news outlets.</p>

    <p>My first three years were supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>. I received an MS in Computer and Information Studies from Penn while working on my PhD. I also hold a BS in Computer Science from Columbia University, where I conducted research at the Natural Language Text Processing Lab and wrote an undergraduate thesis with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/">Kathleen McKeown</a>.</p>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; flex-direction: column;">
    <p>I graduated with my PhD in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/">Boon Thau Loo</a> and <a href="https://www.andrewhead.info">Andrew Head</a>. I studied <b>user interfaces for fine-grained integration of information</b>. I am broadly interested in designing AI-driven products that make complex information easier to understand. I enjoy thinking about many modalities, like reading tools or voice interaction. I am experienced with user research, LLM prototyping, and mixed-methods analysis.</p>
    <h2>I am on the job market!</h2>
    <p>
    I am seeking roles related to user experience research, HCI research, product management, AI strategy, or consulting. Feel free to look through my <a href="assets/files/Alyssa_Hwang_CV.pdf">CV</a>/<a href="assets/files/Alyssa_Hwang_Resume.pdf">resume</a> or send me an email if you would like to chat.
    </p>
    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Beyond research, I was "chair emerita" of the <a href="https://penn-cisda.github.io">CIS Doctoral Association</a> and the founder of our department's Mentorship Program. I have interned at Google and AWS, and my work has been featured by Tech Crunch, the Associated Press, and over 100 other US news outlets. My first three years were supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>. I received an MS in Computer and Information Studies from Penn while working on my PhD. I also hold a BS in Computer Science from Columbia University, where I conducted research at the Natural Language Text Processing Lab and wrote an undergraduate thesis with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/">Kathleen McKeown</a>.</p>

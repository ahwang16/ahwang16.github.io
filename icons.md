I like creating fun, detailed, illustrative icons for my presentation slides. I have uploaded some here and plan to update this page as I prepare for other presentations in the future. You can right-click to copy or save the images.

 Feel free to use or modify my icons. Please just link to me somewhere in your slides or paper!

If you have Keynote, you can download the <a href="/assets/files/full_icon_set.key" class="button pdf lightbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full set of icons</a> to modify them more easily. All icons here were made with Keynote tools.

<summary>Some tips for making your own visuals:</summary>
<ul>
<li>Default to using the rounded rectangle shape. You can adjust the corners to be pointy, but you cannot go the opposite way with the regular rectangle.</li>
<li>Default to using very skinny rectangles instead of lines. They scale better when resizing since lines will keep their thicknesses and end up looking out of proportion at much larger or smaller sizes.</li>
<li>Use a consistent color scheme. The eyedropper tool and <a href="https://coolors.co" target="_blank">coolors.co</a> are your friends. I like to have a slide with colored squares and hex codes for easy copy-paste (it can be hidden or deleted later).</li>
<li>Pay attention to alignment. Take advantage of the "snap to grid" feature more often than not. Having consistently sized items and consistent amounts of spaces between them streamlines the appearance of a slide a lot.</li>
<li>Click and drag a shape while holding "option" to duplicate it. Hold "shift" while resizing to maintain original proportions. Hold "command" while moving or resizing to deactivate "snap to grid" (useful for very super tiny changes). Hold "command" *before* resizing to rotate instead. Hold "command" *and* "shift" while rotating to snap to increments (useful for consistency).</li>
<li>Select multiple objects, right-click, and "group" them to treat them as one item. Useful for building icons with lots of parts.</li>
<li>Play around with selecting two items and "subtracting" them (in the "arrange" panel on the right) to make custom shapes and cutouts.</li>
<li>Play around with laying semi-transparent shapes on top of other items (creates the "fuzzy" effect for de-emphasizing something). Make sure the semi-transparent shape is on top (right-click and "bring to front" or use the "arrange" panel). To simulate a fade-out, go to the colors menu and select "advanged gradient fill."</li>
<li>Instead of going dizzy trying to manage a bunch of slide transitions, duplicate slides and move/delete/add items. This does come with the disadvantage of inflating the number of slides you have, so you can consider making a "printer-friendly" version if applicable.</li>
<li>The one exception: Magic Move.</li>
</ul>

This fellowship competition has a complex set of rules and requirements, and I urge you to double-triple-quadruple the official guidelines. In this document, I will give a brief overview of the NSF GRFP and share some tips based on my experience applying to (and winning!) a fellowship in my senior year of college.</h3>

                    <li>If you do not pursue research full time over the summer (like working at a summer internship), you need to forfeit your fellowship earnings for that period of time.</li><li>You cannot defer your award (unless you are approved for medical or military leave). You need to enroll at a graduate institution and accept the stipend the following fall. This means that you cannot accept the NSF and then decide to take a gap year.</li><li><em>But what if I apply to the NSF and then get rejected from every single school?</em> I don‚Äôt entirely know what happens in this situation. You would probably need to decline the award and apply again, if eligible. Before you freak out any more, consider the following two ideas: (1) if you are a competitive enough applicant to win an NSF, you are probably a competitive enough applicant to be accepted to at least one program, and (2) I have heard of people winning an NSF and successfully asking programs they were rejected from to reconsider (free money + prestige = ooga booga üòç).</li>

Remember that reviewers have a lot of applications to go through and not a lot of time to go through each one, so clarity is key. Aiming for concise, easy-to-understand writing will help you a lot more than beautiful, complex ideas. You also don‚Äôt have to consider this a standard five-paragraph essay‚Äîgo ahead and make use of bold and italic text or headers (or both). Clear structure in your personal statement and research plan will help reviewers pick out the criteria they are looking for (and help you win some $).</p><p><em>The personal statement</em> (officially: Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement) has a maximum length of three pages. This is where you talk about your personal motivation to do research, qualifications to do research (intellectual merit), and contributions, past and future, to your community (broader impacts).</p><p><em>The research plan</em> (officially: Graduate Research Plan Statement) is basically a research proposal. You are not, however, restricted to following this research plan if you are awarded funding. You can consider the research plan for the GRFP as evidence that you can plan a well-scoped research project, rather than a plan that you will actually stick to. The research plan boils down to three main parts: a research question/problem statement, methods for investigation, and expected results.</p><p><em>Research question/problem statement</em>: the exact area(s) you aim to study. Scope is important: too wide and you can‚Äôt possibly complete the project, too narrow and you won‚Äôt make a very significant contribution. You may also want to break down your research question/problem statement into a couple individual goals.</p><p><u>Example of a research question that‚Äôs too wide</u>: How do you apply to graduate school? ‚Äî&gt; There are so many different factors at play here!</p><p><u>Too narrow</u>: How do you apply to the CS PhD program at X University to be advised by Professor Y? ‚Äî&gt; This information can only help a handful of people.<br><br><u>Just right</u>: How do you apply to CS PhD programs in the US? ‚Äî&gt; Plenty of information to be shared without being too overwhelming to collect!</p><p><em>Methods for investigation</em>: how you will answer/explore the research question/problem statement. This part probably requires a bit of literature review and you can include a couple citations if you want. For CS, you‚Äôll probably be looking at algorithms, datasets, computational models, etc.</p><p><em>Expected results</em>: this is what you expect to find and deliver. This might be some new knowledge, data trends, a product, or something else.</p></div>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) 
at the University of Pennsylvania, where I work with Professors [Chris
Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) and
[Andrew Head](https://andrewhead.info/) on the intersection of Natural Language
Processing and Human-Computer Interaction. More specifically, I am interested in
NLP and HCI perspectives on answering subjective questions and the ethical
implications of virtual assistants that _can_ give this sort of advice.

Beyond research, I am involved in the
[CIS Doctoral Association](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cisga/)
(formerly CIS Graduate Association), [CIS Applicant-Support Program](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/), and [Diversity and Equity Initiative
in the Mind Sciences](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dive/) (mind DivE In).

I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I earned my BS in
Computer Science at Columbia University, where I conducted research and wrote an
undergraduate thesis with [Professor Kathleen McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/).

I learned a lot throughout college. I started as a clueless, stressed out freshman at Columbia, and now I'm a slightly less clueless, slightly less stressed out PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I have pursued research for four academic years and two summers (including an undergraduate thesis), interned at Google, and TAed for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in computer science. I remember how scary college can be. All of this information is based on my personal experiences, so some information might be missing or might not apply to you. I just hope that my little stories help make college a little less scary for all of you.

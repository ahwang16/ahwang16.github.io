    title: Ugly Christmas Scarf
    alt: A stranded colorwork knit scarf in the style of an ugly Christmas sweater. It is mostly red and white, with a large green wreath, snowflakes, reindeer, and &quot;MERRY&quot; in big letters. I am wearing it and posing next to some stockings hung on a fireplace with my small fluffy dog, who is trying to lick my nose.

When I was at [DIS 2023](https://dis.acm.org/2023/){:target="_blank"} over the 
summer, I came up with this little points system to help me feel a little more 
comfortable actively participating. All you have to do is try to score as many 
points from the list of tasks below. Maybe you set a goal for yourself each day 
or try to beat your score the next day.

The points are based on how scary I think each task is. This is just for fun 
and trying to make the most out of a conference, so don't be too hard on 
yourself. There is more than one "right" way to attend a conference. Feel free 
to adjust the points for yourself or make up new tasks. Happy conferencing!
